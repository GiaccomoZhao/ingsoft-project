The repository contains projects examples for the SE course.

Other folders are listed in lessons.

## Lesson 1 - Testing

The purpose of this lecture is to understand _the basics of software testing in
practice_. I provide a simple example of using JUnit outside of a Maven project
(credits to [JUnit
quickstart](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/getting-started)). If you
explore the `chat` project, you can see an example of testing the simple model
of a chat system (with groups). I use [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) for
mocking object in case we have dependencies among them.

The source folders for this lesson are:

 + `junit-quickstart` (see README inside);
 + `chat` project.

## Lesson 2 - Socket programming

The source folder is `socket`. See the [README](socket/README.md) inside.

## Lesson 3 - Java RMI

The source folder is `rmi`. See the [README](rmi/README.md) inside.
